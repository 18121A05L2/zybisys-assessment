In this i have mostly focused on functionality , so bare with me in design

-----------   FUNCTIONALITIES   -----------------------

--> displayed list of anime with title, image, rating

-->	Search bar: To search anime by their title

--> Filter: To filter anime according to genres

-->	Create Watchlist: To create watchlist, where user has ability to drag any anime from anime list and drop it to watchlist container

--> implemented local storage for watchlist data : After refreshing the page, watchlist should remain the same 

--> Clicking on Anime card should take user to the page which gives more detail about that anime like synopsis, characters, episodes, aired date, trailer etc
